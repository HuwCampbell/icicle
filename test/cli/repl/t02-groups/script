-- Simplest group-by there is
feature salary ~> group value ~> count

-- Grouping by the date
feature salary ~> group date ~> count

-- Filter before group
feature salary ~> filter value > 100 ~> group date ~> count

-- Filter after group.
-- Note that this gives us counts of zero
feature salary ~> group date ~> filter value > 100 ~> count

-- Group with average
feature salary ~> group date ~> mean value

-- Throw some constants in for good measure
feature salary ~> group date ~> sum (value + 3) * 5
