-- Some simple good ones
feature salary ~> windowed 1 months ~> fold x = 0 : 1 ~> x

feature salary ~> windowed 1 months ~> sum value

feature salary ~> windowed between 1 months and 2 months ~> sum value

-- Some obviously bad ones
feature salary ~> fold x = 0 : 1 ~> x

feature salary ~> sum value

feature salary ~> sum value + count value

-- Part good, part bad

-- More good ones
feature salary ~> latest 10 ~> sum value * count value

-- Some good let bindings
feature salary ~> latest 10 ~> let x = value ~> sum x

feature salary ~> let x = value ~> latest 10 ~> sum x
