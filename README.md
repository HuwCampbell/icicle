icicle
======

A streaming query language.

specification
-------------

A prototype implementation is being built before we finalize the
complete specification.


prototype
---------

### goals

 - identify language primitives.
 - identify a reasonable heuristic for cost, to help elliminate skew in
   the case of distributed computation.
 - determine an appropriate algorithm for arranging and fusing
   computation/expressions.

MTH: Complete. Example expressions, limitations, simplifications, metadata/dictionary.


simulation
----------

MTH: Spec out.


optimisation
------------

To be completed after prototype. A discussion of optimisation techniques
useful to icicle expressions.
